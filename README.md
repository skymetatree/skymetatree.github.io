"**SkyBlock Meta Tree**" is a tree diagram of all the metas that exist in Hypixel SkyBlock. It's main purpose is to answer the questions "What is there to do?", "At what stage of the game am I?" and "What items do I need to progress from here?".

Each stage of tha game has it's own box with a title, 4 armor pieces, 1 pet, 1 main weapon, 3 skill requirements (min_skill 1-3), 4 ability items and the best income strategy including the average coins per hour.

## Data Submissions
Fill out the form over at https://skymetatree.github.io/submit/. This will - in the background - send your submitted META to a google sheet in a format that can directly be copy-pasted into the json data structure of this project.

Note: The rarity of an item is displayed using &c, &u, &r, &e, &l, &m, &d, &s and &v at the beginning of each item name, representing the first letter of that rarity (c = common, u = uncommon, r = rare and so on). This changes the text color according to the settings in the styles.css file.
