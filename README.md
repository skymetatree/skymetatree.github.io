"**SkyBlock Meta Tree**" is a tree diagramm of all the metas that exist in Hypixel SkyBlock. It's main purpose is to answer the questions "What is there to do?" "At what stage of the game am I?" and "What do I need to progress from here?".

Each stage of tha game has it's own box with a title, 4 armor pieces, 1 pet, 1 main weapon, 3 skill requirements (min_skill 1-3), 4 ability items and the best money strategy including the average coins per hour.

The rarity of an item can be added using &c, &u, &r, &e, &l, &m, &d, &s and &v at the beginning of each item name, representing the first letter of that rarity (c = common, u = uncommon, r = rare and so on). This changes the text color accordingly.
