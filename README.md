"**SkyBlock Meta Tree**" is a tree diagram of all the metas that exist in Hypixel SkyBlock. It's main purpose is to answer the questions "What is there to do?", "At what stage of the game am I?" and "What items do I need to progress from here?".

Each stage of tha game has it's own box with a title, 4 armor pieces, 1 pet, 1 main weapon, 3 skill requirements (min_skill 1-3), 4 ability items and the best income strategy including the average coins per hour.

## Data Submissions
Use [this template](https://github.com/skymetatree/skymetatree.github.io/discussions/2) in the discussions section to create a new entry in the 'new data' category. Alternatively you can fork the repository, add the data to the data constant in the index.html file yourself and create a pull request once you are done.

Note: The rarity of an item can be added using &c, &u, &r, &e, &l, &m, &d, &s and &v at the beginning of each item name, representing the first letter of that rarity (c = common, u = uncommon, r = rare and so on). This changes the text color according to the settings in the styles.css file.
