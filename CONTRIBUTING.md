# Contributing to SkyMetaTree

## Required Hardware and Software
- [Brackets IDE](https://brackets.io/) is recommended, but for json-data edits even a simple text editor should do

## Getting Started
1. Log into github
2. Fork this repository
3. Clone the project to your local machine
    - git command or some GUI (I for example used SourceTree)
4. Open the folder with the Brackets IDE or just the index.html with a text editor depending on what you want to do
5. (Wait for the project / file to fully load)
6. Now you can change files and - if you chose the Brackets IDE - test the website in a local environment
7. Once you are you are happy with your result you can commit and push everything to a new branch of your forked project
8. If you want to create a pull request you can do that on the github page of your forked project
    - github automatically offers you that option once you've made changes to your forked project
